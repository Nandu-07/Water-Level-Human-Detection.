# Water Level and Human Detection System

## Description
This project uses an Arduino to detect water levels and human presence in the water. It includes an ultrasonic sensor for water level measurement, a DHT22 temperature sensor for human detection, and RGB LEDs and a buzzer for notifications.

### Features
- Detects low, medium, and high water levels.
- Detects human presence based on temperature (~37Â°C).
- RGB LED and buzzer feedback for different water levels.
- LCD display shows real-time distance and temperature.

### Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- RGB LED
- Buzzer
- LCD Display (16x2)

### How to Use
1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the components as described in the code.
3. The system will detect water levels and human presence in the water.
